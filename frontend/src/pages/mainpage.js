            Healing Magen Yoga Therapy is the process of enabling people to progress towards improved health 
            and well-being through the application of the teachings and practices of yoga.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yoga therapy is an ancient healing art backed by modern biomedical peer-reviewed research 
            and evidence-based practices. An open-minded approach based on multiple lineages ensures 
            that students can understand various applications of yoga tools and techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core belief in yoga for all gives students the skill set to work with a wide range of people from different backgrounds. 
            Healing occurs by turning inward. The education of a yoga therapist should include self-reflection and assessment, 
            as well as extensive training in the science and practical application of the ancient teachings of yoga and Ayurveda.
