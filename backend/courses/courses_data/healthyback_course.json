    "description": "Designed for participants suffering from chronic low back pain and wanting to achieve a higher level of functioning to minimize and relieve pain. The Yoga Therapy Course program is developed based on direct experience and the principles of Healing Magen Yoga. These Course of Yoga Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) sessions differ from regular yoga classes in that the yoga therapy program includes a standardized protocol and teaching instructions. Non-specific chronic low back pain lasting more than 12 weeks affects approximately 5-10% of adults. Examples include a large herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or vertebral compression fracture. However, most patients are classified as having non-specific chronic low back pain. Non-specific CLBP accounts for the majority of back-related healthcare costs. Yoga therapy for CLBP is aimed at an initial period of 8-16 weeks. To maintain good control and long-term results of yoga therapy for CLBP, a continuous approach to the treatment of this chronic condition is necessary. Therefore, yoga therapy for CLBP is based on long-term models designed to maintain clinical effectiveness and support patient adherence to a healthy yoga lifestyle.",
